# Rejected Domination
Current game in progress: RD 1 - Eternal Equinox

Currently, the project is work-in progress.

##How do I help improving the project?
You can let me know of idea contradictions, requests to be added in the game as a cameo, add your thoughts about the ideas, and following the game page on GameJolt.

##So, how do I follow the game page?
[Oh look, everything](http://gamejolt.com/games/project-domination/44303)

##Is there anything I can help you with? Like actually helping to contribute in the project?
Currently, I will only allow people to send request to be added in the game as a character. I do not allow anyone to help my work, to avoid people from making wrong illustrations, thoughts and changes to the project.

Sorry, this is **SOLE INDIE GAME DEVELOPMENT**.

##How do I get added to the game?
There are a number of unique sacrifices and requirements to get added in the game project:
###1. Be a member of GameJolt.
This project is made possible by GameJolt. In order to fully support the project, you must support the supporter of the project, as well.

###2. Understand the concept of Rejected Domination.
You are not allowed to make something outside Rejected Domination's boundaries of concept. You must not allow yourself to forward the project's idea to something else. References are allowed, as long as you give credit to the owners of the trademarks.

###3. Send the concept art of your character.
Most of the time, secondary characters are not created by Alexander. We want you to give us your preferred taste of character looks.

###4. Send the name you want to use as an alias; it must truly represent you, and only you.
You cannot create an alias that leads to bullshit. We do not allow stupid names like *"YOURMOM.EXE", "Ass", "Bob Saget" or "Steven Blowjobbs"*. We only allow names with a surname and first name. Middle names are optional.

###5. Send the detailed bio of your character.
In order to create a character, you must fill in the blanks. In this case, they are almost the same number of holes in a Swiss cheese. It takes a while for me to read them and review them, so be patient :)

Rejected Domination is an idea. It can be any game possible; from Danmaku games, Visual novel point-and-click games, adventure games to platformers, arcade games and RPGs.

There are rules that should be followed when creatin a bio for your character in Rejected Domination:

1. The minimal age for a character is 48 months old.

2. Make sure that it fits the concept of the project.

3. Do not use the name "John Cabangcala" anywhere for your character.

4. Come up with the character's story. *This is optional.*

5. Do not make an evil character.

6. Please don't add something completely impure and immature to the character.

7. You cannot plagiarize it from an another bio. Keep it original.

8. Create your own weapon for the character, how it works, its name and its detailed information. *This is optional*

9. Make sure that the character wears clothes that suit the character. You cannot have the girl character wearing a bra and a mini-skirt.

10. Create the character's personality and gender. Don't worry, gender benders. We allow characters that are not heterosexual ^_^

11. We do not allow characters that denotes discrimination.

12. You can choose between two types of a character only: [Lunar and Solar type.](http://ramenitro.blogspot.com/2015/05/dreamweaver.html)
13. Do not add something related to satanism on the chracter.

14. Come up with their dream world, its info and its layout.

15. Make sure that the character is a Dreamweaver.

By creating the character, you agree to the rules of submitting the character.

##Oh boy! Now what?
I just need a bit more of time for the project, considering that I work alone on my resources. We've already set our hearts on making this project, so let's make it possible, together we will make the world right and fantastic!
